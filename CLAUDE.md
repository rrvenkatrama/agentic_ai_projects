# AI Engineer Program — Claude Context

## What This Is
A project-based 4-month self-training curriculum to become an Agentic AI Engineer.
Claude acts as trainer/guide — building every project together, explaining concepts inline.
No passive video courses — learning by doing, with deeplearning.ai shorts on-demand as needed.

## The Person
- Rajesh Ramani, 54, program manager background (infrastructure domain, Apple)
- CS degree 1989, languages: C, C++, PHP, decent Python, web apps
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate
- 15+ years away from core dev, returning now
- Real-world agentic work at Onemyle startup (augments this training)
- Goal: Agentic AI Engineer positions within 4 months (by ~July 2026)

## Kanban Tracking
- Tool: MyKanban at http://192.168.1.156:3002
- Project: "AI Engineering Readiness" (Project ID: 3)
- Login: see local credentials (not committed)
- Tickets: #17–#73 (growing)
- Move tickets: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Done as work progresses

## Python Environment
- Repo: ~/ai/ai_engineer_program/
- Venv: ~/ai/ai_engineer_program/.venv/
- Activate: source .venv/bin/activate
- Keys: copy .env.example to .env, add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY etc.

## The 14-Project Curriculum (v6 — updated 2026-04-29)

### v6 Changes (driven by real Oracle/Salesforce/Adobe/Airwallex job postings)
- **P7 expanded**: + Ragas, DeepEval, Promptfoo eval frameworks (#79)
- **P10 expanded**: + FastAPI wrapper, Pinecone, multi-cloud LLM routing, reliability patterns, cost tracking (#74-#78)
- **P12 NEW**: Multi-agent framework showdown — AutoGen vs LangGraph vs CrewAI (#80)

### Business Domain Theme: Enterprise Customer Operations
P7–P11 follow a coherent real-world domain: a suite of agents for customer operations.
Uses Faker for synthetic customer data. Connects naturally to Onemyle's real work.

## Path B — AI Product Management Track (added 2026-05-01)

Parallel PM artifact track integrated into P7-P12. Modern Agile/Lean approach (no waterfall PMP-style docs).
Each remaining project produces 1-page artifacts alongside the engineering work.

### Templates (in `p0_pm_templates/`)
- 1-page PRD · ICP · Eval Plan · GTM Brief · Risk Register · Working Backwards PR · Buy-vs-Build

### Reference Doc
- `p0_pm_templates/ai_product_management.html` — comprehensive AI PM reference: terminology, frameworks, AI-specific concepts, interview prep, project log appendix that grows per project

### PM Artifacts per Project (Kanban tickets #81-#86)

| # | Project | Artifacts |
|---|---------|-----------|
| #81 | P7 Customer Health | PRD + ICP + Eval Plan + GTM Brief |
| #82 | P8 PII Compliance | PRD + ICP + Eval Plan + Risk Register |
| #83 | P9 Account Memory | PRD + ICP + Eval Plan + GTM Brief + Working Backwards |
| #84 | P10 AgentPlatform | PRD + ICP + GTM Brief + Risk Register + Working Backwards + Buy-vs-Build |
| #85 | P11 Contract Analyzer | PRD + ICP + Eval Plan + GTM Brief + Risk Register |
| #86 | P12 Framework Showdown | Decision Framework + LinkedIn blog (research project, different artifacts) |

### Workflow per project
1. Finish engineering work (existing tickets)
2. Open PM ticket (#81+) → copy templates into `pX_xxx/pm/` folder
3. Fill in artifacts (~1-2 hours per project)
4. Review for AI-PM-specific framing (eval criteria, cost-per-task, hallucination budget, ICP/anti-ICP rigor)
5. Mark ticket Done

### Why Path B (not parallel PM curriculum)
- Same projects → two evidence stacks (engineering portfolio + PM artifacts)
- Path A (sequential) delays PM positioning by ~3 months
- Path C (parallel curriculum) doesn't compound — one-shot artifacts vs growing codebase
- Path B leverages Apple TPM background + Onemyle "Product Consultant" role + RAFL patent
- Targets unicorn profile: AI Engineer + AI PM (most candidates are one or the other)

## Training Resources (on-demand, not upfront)
| Course | Platform | When to use |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| LangChain for LLM Application Development — Andrew Ng | deeplearning.ai | Before P2 |
| AI Agents in LangGraph | deeplearning.ai | Before P3 |
| Multi-Agent Systems with CrewAI | deeplearning.ai | Before P5 |
| Evaluating and Debugging Generative AI | deeplearning.ai | Before P7 |
| Complete Agentic AI Engineering Course | Udemy (owned) | Reference throughout |

## LLM Coverage
All three major LLMs are used across the curriculum — not Claude-only:
- **Anthropic Claude** (claude-sonnet-4-6 / claude-opus-4-7) — primary, tool_use, MCP, vision
- **OpenAI** (gpt-4o) — function calling, multi-modal comparison
- **Google Gemini** — function calling, multi-modal
All three API keys are in .env: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, GEMINI_API_KEY

## Claude's Role as Trainer
- Give Rajesh coding goals — let him write the code, then review and correct inline
- Do NOT scaffold everything — only scaffold to unblock, not replace the learning
- Explain every concept as it appears in real code (not abstract)
- Give daily tasks sized for ~2–3 hours of focused work
- Point to deeplearning.ai shorts only when concept needs lecture reinforcement
- Move Kanban tickets as milestones are hit
- Run a 5–8 question quiz at end of EVERY project before moving to the next one

## Training Style (Non-negotiable)
1. **Interactive coding** — Give a goal + any needed context/signature. Rajesh writes it. Review after.
2. **End-of-project quiz** — Before starting next project, quiz on concepts from the one just completed.
   Questions should reference actual code from the project, not abstract theory.
3. **Detailed step-by-step instructions** — For every coding task, give numbered steps with: what to write, what it does, why it's needed. Include code snippets per step. Not high-level bullets.

## Daily Plan Structure
Each session: Claude gives the day's task, Rajesh codes it, concepts explained inline.
Weekly plan tickets in Kanban track the week's goals.
